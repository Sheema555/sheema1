            <h2>INRODUCTION</h2>
            <p>Welcome to ROBOTIC PROCESS AUTOMATION. We provide top-notch services to our clients.
 Robotic process automation (RPA) is a form of software robots (bots) or business process automation that is based on
 artificial intelligence (AI) software robotics (not to be confused with 
agents. It is sometimes referred to as robot software). In traditional workflow automation tools, a automate a task and interface to the interfaces (APIs) or dedicated software developer produces a list of actions to back end system using internal application programming scripting language. In contrast, RPA systems develop the action
 list by watching the user perform that task in the application's graphical user interface (GUI), and then perform the automation by repeating those tasks directly in the GUI. This can lower the barrier to the use of automation in products that might not otherwise feature APIs for this purpose.
 RPA tools have strong technical similarities to also automate interactions with the graphical user interface testing tools. These tools GUI, and often do so by repeating a set of demonstration actions performed by a user. RPA tools differ from such systems in that they allow data to be handled in and between multiple applications, for instance, receiving email containing an invoice, extracting the data, and then typing that into a  bookkeeping system.

<p> A.INRODUCTION OF RPA:
RPA in Data Analytics Many things help a business succeed. Great employees, cutting-edge technology, good customer service, and good marketing can take a business to the next level. However, data may be more critical to businesses than any business. Data plays a vital role in different businesses for different reasons. It helps make decisions, identify trends, and many other things that benefit the business. Businesses have no shortage of data to use, and the amount of new data generated is expected to be significant. Now a days RPA is used in various industries, some of them are as follow: 
<li>Banking and Financial Sector</li> 
<li> Insurance Sector</li> 
<li> Manufacturing Industries</li> 
<li> Lifesciences</li>
Unfortunately, extensive data analysis is not always easy. Therefore, doing everything manually is not possible most of the time. Analyzing the data manually can be extremely time-consuming, difficult, and boring. As a result, various businesses are leveraging RPA (robot process automation) to help them analyze data. For example: RPA enables a higher efficiency in human actions, just like AI and chatbots.Click to explore about our, Best Open Source RPA Tools  

<li>Challenge: The process of creating policy documents manually was tedious-process and error-prone. The workload increased daily due to an increase in the number of customers. The client wanted to validate, standardize, and auto-upload the data to the client's system before 11:30 pm to run a batch process for policy document creation.</li>

<li>Solution: RPA bot can port the raw data received from multiple sources and convert it into a standard file format. It can perform data validation and massaging using complex business rules to generate a standard output file. AI algorithms were applied to read, interpret, and comprehend large amounts of multilingual unstructured data from different channel partners.</li>

<p>B. VISION, Mission and values of the RPA:
Robotic process automation (RPA) is a technology that mimics how humans interact with software to perform repetitive, high-volume tasks. RPA technology creates software programs or robots that
connect to applications, enter data, calculate, perform tasks, and copy data between applications or workflows as they work. Necessary needs.

<p>C. What is Analytics?
First, you need to know what analysis is? Analysis means a detailed study or examination of something to understand more. Data analytics is the process of examining a dataset to find trends
and infer the information contained therein.
Analysis reveals hidden patterns in the world around us, from consumer behavior, athletes, and team performance to discovering the connection between activity and illness. This can change how we
view the world and is usually heading in the right direction. Sometimes we think the process is already working optimally, but sometimes the data shows that it isn't, so analysis helps improve our
world.
In the business world, organizations typically apply analytics to describe, predict, and improve a company's business performance. Specifically, it is helpful in the following areas:
1. Fraud analysis
2. Risk analysis
3. Web analytics
4. Advertisement and marketing
5. Enterprise decision management
6. Market optimization
7. Market modeling

<p>D. Organisational structure:
RPA technologies are used by businesses to manage a variety of processes effectively. But how is robotics data analysis changing, and what are the benefits of using RPA? If that is the question you
are wondering, this blog post will be perfect for you, as we will be looking at some of the benefits of using a robot as an RPA system for data analysis.

1. Reduction of Errors:
One of the most significant benefits of RPA and robotics for data analysis is the reduction of errors.
When people manually analyze data, errors happen often and can render certain types of data unusable or worthless to your business. Automated robots and software are not hacked or distracted
by anything, so you can be sure that your data will be of higher quality and with fewer errors if you use automation. In addition to reducing errors and improving the quality of your data, it can also
improve customer satisfaction.

2. Decreasing Costs:
Reducing costs is another significant benefit of automation. Staffing entire departments to analyze data is costly. This can be expensive, and these agents are unlikely to be as accurate or efficient as Robotic Process Automation technology. These technologies are affordable and easy to implement,and not challenging to get started. Over time, you'll be able to do more critical and creative tasks (such as emotional intelligence, reasoning, etc.) that may need human brains with the help of data analysis staff, saving you money.

Data Analytics and RPA Together
RPA can be leveraged to develop and maintain well-structured and correctly classified data in enterprise systems and create data lakes to develop advanced machine learning models for
applications. The RPA software robot can operate through one or more software applications. In this case of data cleaning and analysis, RPA can work with big data analytics toolkits and help businesses
in four ways:
1. Rather than manual entry or file submission, data entry can be fully automated.
2. Automated migration of data between different enterprise applications, ie. Migrate the system during a merger or acquisition.
3. With automated data tracking, RPA can continuously check for data anomalies and improve data consistency without human intervention.
4. Automate data replication and retrieve new data streams, such as IoT computer logs and other system-generated data.

<p>F. Performance of the organization in terms of  
Turnover ,profits ,market reach and market value:
The robotic process automation (RPA) market was estimated to be worth 3.7 billion U.S. dollars in 2022. This market is forecast to grow with a CAGR of 36.6 percent from 2022 to 2032. The market size is expected to be valued at 81.8 billion U.S. dollars by 2032.
</p>

<p>G. Futuru plans of organisation:
To begin, let's look at the changes to RPA bots themselves.
	Bots will become more resilient, thanks to AI. ...
	Bots will be better equipped to work with data. ...
	The RPA market will grow, but slowly. ...
	The RPA market will become more competitive. ...
	RPA will be embedded in other tools rather than sold as a standalone offering.</p>
